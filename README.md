# Goal
The goal was to train a classifier that would be able to make difference between cats and dogs.
In this project, I have created a GUI interface on which we can insert a picture and classify it.

# GUI
<img src="images/catpred.png" width="400" height="400">
<img src="images/dog_pred.png" width="400" height="400">

# Results
<img src="images/result.png" width="400" height="400">
